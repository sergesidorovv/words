Programming an epub to txt application

An Epub file is made up of html pages which are zipped up

1.
Extract epub

2.
Remove all folders

3.
search and open file *.opf

This file contains a list of all the files in the zip folder, 
and the order they are meant to be read in.
It also contains metadata detailing: 
title,identifier,subject,creator,contributor,description,publisher,language

4.
find the term <manifest>
record <item id= & href= pairs
discount anything before the "/" in the href location because we removed the folder structures

5.
find the term <spine
The idref's are listed in order of reading.
so get convertor to find "id" after "idref="
and then use the "href=" pair name to find file to convert first

6.
delete everything between these two characters "<" & ">"

7.
repeat for all other html files

8.
combine files to one txt file
